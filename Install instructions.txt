*NEW ARMOR*: ADEPTAS ELOHIM Armor, I've not coded any hard limit on using it on lower rank Battle Sisters, aside for the price, it offers a decent upgrade over the starting Sisters armor.
*NEW ARMOR*: ADEPTAS RETRIBUTOR Armor, sacrificing rear, under and flank armor, as well as melee ability, the Retributor armor strength enables it to use heavy weapons with ease and have advanced targeting systems. Custom voice lines included!
*NEW ARMOR*: ADEPTAS SISTER SUPERIOR Armor. Only max ranked Battle Sisters can be promoted to Sister Superior, on their way to becoming the Canoness! This is a rather good suit of armor, a step up from the Elohim. Got custom voice lines.
*NEW WEAPONS*: See the forum thread for a full list of added weapons.
There are several bolters, boltpistols, heavy bolters, plasma weapons and exotic weapons added. Sisters gets pretty much a new weapon in each class tuned to their playstyle and new weapons in mid and high-tier.
This included a Storm Bolter, an Assault Cannon, a Graviton gun, a Neural Whip, a Choir Projector, a Shotgun, a Grenade Launcher and so on.
Example:
ADEPTAS ELOHIM BOLTER. A heavier high power bolter, with only a double tap autofire, but greater range and accuracy, as well as the ability to use INFERNO rounds and AP rounds. 
*NEW AMMO*: Adeptas De'az and Elohim bolters can now use the Light Bolter Inferno Rounds, expensive but highly effective against meaty boys and daemons alike.
*NEW SPRITE*: Alternative darker red version of the basic Sisters armor is now selectable from the armor menu on all Battle Sisters.
*NEW ENEMY*: Meganobz make their entrance thanks to the great spritework of Xom126, current code isn't too fancy but they come armed with new Twin Shootas (think stormbolter, but orky), Rokkit launchers (to emulate their "kombi shootas") and for melee: Power Klaws and Killa Klaws.
*NEW ENEMY*: Ork Bike enters the field, as a 2x2 unit! Thanks to the spritework of Xom126. Armed with Deffgunz and their own rammin' ability, they're not very accurate or hardy, but very mobile. They will explode on death (unless melee'd/Stunned).
*NEW ENEMY*: BURNA BOYZ are armed with Burnas, these are lethal in close combat. They will also explode if shot up, but can be taken down safely in melee or from stuns.
*NEW ENEMY*: Ork Kommandoz are skulking about, armed with very sneaky shivs and even sneakier sluggas (As well as the occasional heavier Ork weaponry), they can throw smoke to confound you and are pretty hard to spot. Bring light sources and/or scouts!
*NEW ENEMY*: STORMBOYZ takes to the sky and comes down, one way or another. Mostly a close combat unit with high mobility, they can probably lob those grenades pretty far.
*NEW ENEMY/WIP*: Ork Warboss can now be encountered in high level Ork bases! Thanks to the sprite work of Xom126.
*NEW ENEMY WEAPONS*: 
-Orks now have access to the BURNA/SCORCHA combo flamethrower/melta weapon. Very dangerous up close. More weapon sprite crafting from Xom126.
-Orks have access to Sneaky close combat weapons, a shiv and a slugga, used by the Kommandoz.
-Orks have access to Stinkbombz, which can stun and knock-out your units!
-Orks have access to Gorkfausts, one-use rokkits for close combat anit armour work.
-Orks have access to Krakk Stikk Bombz, much like the Krakk grenades, but Orky!
-Orks have access to Tankbusta bombs, think very big melta bombs. Short throwing range luckily! Used by Tankbustaz.
-Orks have access to Tank Hammer, a dedicated anti armor rocket hammer. Don't let them slap you with this.

*IN PROGRESS* INVENTORY SPRITES, ELOHIM/RETRIBUTOR/SUPERIOR + FRATERIS inventory sprites, as well as for many enemy units.
*IN PROGRESS* UNITUI baby sprites for deployment lineup on ships, needed for Elohim/Retributor/Superior armor sets. Uses standard sisters right now.
*IN PROGRESS* TANKBUSTAZ: Ingame without custom sprites, armed with new Krakk Stikks, Tankbusta bombs, Tankhammers and Gorkfausts they are formiddable anti-armor foes.
*IN PROGRESS* ATTACK SQUIGS: Thanks to the spritework of Xom126, these toothy Squigs can be deployed by Orks and Gretchin to hunt you down!
*IN PROGRESS* BOMB SQUIGS: Accompanying the Tankbustaz are these toothy mobile homing mines. Reworked from Xom126 base Squig sprite.
*IN PROGRESS* KOMMANDO NOBZ: Even hardier Ork*
*IN PROGRESS* SISTERS OF KHORNE, Khorne Retributors and DemiBloodletters, these are the high end Khorne sister units.
*IN PROGRESS* NOVICE MEDICAE: An earlier medic for Sisters that can upgrade to Hospitaller.


in the Future:
*SISTER RETRIBUTOR ARMOR UPGRADE PATH*
ORK BOSS: A step above Nobz, one below the Warboss.
*Coded, on the in-the-future-list: Da Revolushun! Gonna be a whole load of Grots.
*Partially coded, needs cleanup*: Sisters can now fall to/Embrace CHAOS! Much like the Marine option, it enables them to produce Chaos Sister outfits after researching a bunch of Chaos corrupting artifacts! 

Cost changes:
Tweaked cost changes to slot in the new Elohim/Retributor/Superior armor sets. 
Hospitaller armor now pricier.

Balance changes: 
Most Grenades now limited to 10-16 throwing range, rather than 20 across the board. Especially the more powerful grenades now have <15 range, which should ease up a little on the AI tossin' grenades across the screen, while guns have an effective range of <10 tiles.
Daemons are now tougher. Some may use the powers of the warp.
Nurgle Lads and Ladettes are now healthier to distinguish them from runtier Chaos Boyz.
Chaos Dreads are now Dreadfully healthy (or 1-2 bolter shots healthier).


Intent:
Sisters of Battle (Adepta Sororitas) are now an ideal entrypoint to the 40k mod for new players. 
They start out with basic power armor, have good starting stats and decent bolter weapons.
New recruits also get their power armor for free, and the reworked repentia armor allows for rookies to earn their pay with a different playstyle.

-Imperial guard have been slightly buffed as well to be more survivable and less of a hassle to play early on. 
-Primarily their carapace armor got a slight of armor buff forwards, and a nerf in the rear (from 50 all around to 60-80 front depending on type, 30 rear).
-Guardsmen are also cheaper to pay in wages.

All Heavy Bolters have their "dropoff" range cut in half, they are no longer 24 tile sniper guns, but still quite good.

New Enemies: The Forces of Chaos have been reinforced with more dedicated Heretic, Corrupted, Fallen and straight up Chaos worshipping Sisters of Battle!
They do not yet have their own bases, but will show up on almost all mission types.

New Sisters factions that can appear in battle:
-The Chaos Sisters Undivided, a mix of the best the various Chaos Sisters can offer, led by a powerful Tzeentch Canoness!  
-The Emperors Daughters, Slaaneshi elite sisters. Led by a Chaos Canoness, they have good armor and very good weapons. They bring flying terror units for flanking!
-The Slaaneshi Sisters are led by a Slaaneshi Palatine, and have access to more Daemonettes than most! Plus, the new flying ones!
-The Slaaneshi Terror unit have access to Repentia and Assassins, as well as many Daemonettes to make your life a pain.
-The Khorne Sisters, expect many Khorne Repentia, Penitent engines, Bloodletters and Assassins.
-The Nurgle Caretakers, led by elite Nurgle Hospitaller, these sisters are very tough and have access to spit and blight attacks. They bring Nurgle Plaguebearers with them.
-The Silent Sisters, Tzeentch finest, krak grenades, plasma weapons, penitent engines, Flamer demons and perhaps a sneaky assassin.
-Heretic Sisters, not quite fallen to Chaos yet but well on their way. Led by a strong Canoness and Palatine combo, this faction have access to both Hospitaller, Seraphs, Repentia and the Penitent Engine.
-Radical Sisters - Led by a Radical and very Heretical Inquisitor, this Tzeentch faction have strange Xeno artifacts and perhaps even, a twisted Eldar Banshee!
-The Seraph Sisters, Khorne and Slaanesh can't quite decide where these sisters fall on the Violence and Decadence scale, but these sisters are all flying, led by a Corrupted Celestian they have access to the new flying Daemonettes.
-The Repentia Revengeance, Tebel repentia as far as the eye can see, led by a fallen Canoness and backed by Bloodletters and Assassins. 
-Adepta Deserters [75% implemented]: These early game enemies are a mix of Adepta and Imperial Guard, all deserters of course. Lacking some custom art for certain Deserter Guard units (then again, they are recent deserters!).

-The New Chaos Sisters are on average 63% more dressed than before. 

New Player Units:
-Adepta Novices join the fray, they've gotten a couple of years of military instruction so they're no slouches in combat, but don't expect full Adeptas performance just yet! They do have their own voice lines.
They wear Carapace tier *very* light power armor. They're 1/3rd the cost of a Sister to both recruit and pay for!
-At the rank Cantus (rank_2), Novices can get their own set of Cantus Power Armor on the cheap (you can produce it at any time for a higher cost). This armor is approaching Sororitas Power Armor in performance. It comes with updated Novice voice lines (some new ones). 
At the rank of Novitiate (rank 3), Novices can be promoted to Adeptas Sororitas, if they meet the minimum requirements (Stats, 20 devotionm some TU/Stamina/Bravery/Strength over the minimum possible roll).
-Adeptas Sororitas can now promote to Sister Superior! They need to reach their max rank and meet the minimum stat requirements, including 50 devotion. She got some unique voice lines!.
The new Sister Superior upon reaching max rank can now promote to Canoness instead of Adeptas Sororitas!
-Work in progress: New ADeptas-, and Callidus Assassin recruits.

New Enemies (the Forces of Chaos grow ever larger!):
All follow a similar design philosophy, with the new corrupt Sisters making up the ranks of the various Chaos gods.
Aside for the 4 gods, "Undivided" is represented by HERETIC Sisters and (Chaos) Sisters United. They have their own forces that can show up on various missions, including terror missions.
-Heretic Sister forces are closest to "mirror" Adeptas force. Including Penitent engines.
The 4 Chaos Gods flavors of Icecream/Adeptas in order of how fleshed out/complete they are:
-Slaanesh Sisters! Salacious, scandalous and sensational servants of Slaanesh. Split between the "perfectionist" Devoted Daughters of Slaanesh and the more... depraved and deformed Brides of the Sublime Prince.
On the heavier armored side the Devoted Daughters of Slaanesh bring Dominion, Seraphim and Celestians to the field of battle. They have access to heavy weapons, melee power swords and ranged noise weapons, they have good armor and high reactions and do not bring as many daemonettes (that said, they may still be Blessed by Slaanesh).
The Brides of the Sublime Prince not only bring plenty of Daemonettes, but the new flying Harpy type! Not only that, but they are quite likely to turn into Demi-Daemonettes themselves when torn up in battle, and can eventually mature into Daemonettes as well. In the future, other Slaanesh demons will join the fray. 
There's some mixed variants and updates to existing Slaanesh forces that may deploy.
Rumors have it they are led by a Slaanesh Sister Demon Princess and Slaaneshi Chosen.
-Sisters of Khorne! Two factions, the Repentia Revengeance bring plenty of chainsaw melee to the battlefield, at the cost of armor. The other is the "Valkia" Sisters, gradually turning into Bloodletter Sisters, they are heavily armed with flamethrowers, retributors, melta and plasmaguns.
The Repentia Revengeance have to kinds of Repentia, light and heavy, as well as Khorne Death Cult Assassins. Expect phosphor grenades and chain-based cutting implements.
The Khorne Retributors are heavily armed and armored, expect heavy firepower and AoE attacks. Some may so angry they are hard to kill, and have been blessed by Khorne with fisting implements of great destructive power.
-Daughters of Nurgle! Hospitallers, Blightbearers and Sisters of Filth, a mix of true believers and undisciplined defectors, Nurgle Sisters have access to blight weaponry and can on occasion bring Plaguebearers (and soon, other Nurgle demons) into this world.
Tough, they bring plenty of Damage over time in the form of health directed blight attacks, as well as access to certain "Acid" attacks. 
-Sisters of Tzeentch
Long ranged firepower, currently represented by Tzeentch Assassins, as well ass corrupted renegade Inquisitors and other Sisters engaged in forbidden knowledge.
Expect a higher frequency of plasma, krak/xeno-grenades and long ranged sniper weapons and missile launchers. Up close they do like their flamers.

Update 2:
Added:
-Enemy Commanders and some sorceror/demon leaders will now have access to a "summon" ability, in the form of a grenade like attack that causes morale/stun (and in certain cases, light fire or acid damage), which summons a demon. Enjoy!

Enemies:
Undivided:
-New Fallen sister, using the Adeptas zombie sprite and armor. This corrupted sister is quite weak and serves as an early/grunt Sister type enemy one step below the Heretic Sisters.
Does have access to the new Weak Seduction attack. Cover your ears for heresy.
Can appear wherever there is heresy, but especially in Slaaneshi and Tzeentch forces.

Khorne:
-New Repentia Superior will now be leading the Repentia Revengeance, she's a elite Khorne warrior with access to CLAWS melee attack (to simulate her whippin' action, alas - no real whip yet).
-New Armored Khorne Sister, she's backing up the Repentia Superior. With a special fist attack she's deadly up close.
Both using the new Adeptas Khorne armor, based on the RED/BLACK SoB armor set the Heretic sisters use, but with a red face mask and shoulders (plus some studs). 
It has a built in FIST weapon and RAGE "shield" which can absorb a little damage each turn.

Slaanesh
-The Emperors Daughters are now led by a SLAANESHI CHOSEN, a winged Slaaneshi Sister on parity with the LIVING SAINT. She has access to long ranged seduction/psi attacks.
-New White armored Slaaneshi Elite sprite set for the Emperors Daughters elite troops.
-New Slaaneshi Devoted, without power armor (using a new spritesheet shared with the new Slaaneshi Assassin) they are fast and deadly close range fighters.
-New Slaaneshi Assassin, very fast light attacker with high reactions but low aim, with access to plasma pistols, power swords, eviscerator and sniper rifles.
-New Slaaneshi Celestian, in purple armor she leads the Slaaneshi Seraph forces in battle. 
-Certain Blessed Slaanesh units may now be reborn on death in the image of the Perfect Prince! These units are a little weaker than their "normal" equivalents. 

Nurgle
-New Enemy: Nurgle Blighted, cultists and weakly armored, these chemtroopers have access to a lot of blight grenades and nurgles spit attack.
-Some Sisters blessed by Papa Nurgle may now be reborn in death as a Daughter of Nurgle.

Tzeentch:
-New Enemy: Tzeentch Assassin, highly accurate and mobile, armed with either the sniper rifle or a close range kit of plasma pistol and power sword.
-Some Tzeentch blessed units may now be reborn into new forms on death according to the whims of Tzeentch.  

New Aux Attacks:
Gone through Chaos sisters and added in Medium and Weak Seduction attacks (where the standard one is 200 power with high accuracy, these are more than halved).
Slaaneshi leaders and some special sisters generally get the higher end seduction attack, but Tzeentch and Nurgle can also turn troops.

Summarized balance changelog:
-Costs cut by 50-75% for things like adamantium and promethium, to cut down on the grind. It's still a long hard game though!
-Drop off range for bolters and lasguns extended, for some doubled from base mod (5->8-10).
-Bolters have been buffed and given some nichés. A little more damage in the 5-10 range. 
-Full sized bolters have a range and damage advantage, but light bolters have some special quirks. 
-Plasma has been made less accurate, still powerful though.

-Adepta power armor has been buffed, especially on the high end to compare more favorably with Space Marines. 
-Adepta power armor will give various stat buffs, as will the Repentia->Assassin line.
-Flying armor is weaker in protection, but well, it can fly. Use for those sweet long ranged shots, flanking or grenade lobbing.
-Sisters have also been somewhat buffed on their top end stat potential.

-Imperial Guard armor have been buffed and many negative modifiers have been removed (-10 strength for example). 
-The officers also get slightly better armor
-The Stormtrooper armor sets now top out at 90 front armor, which is only slightly below what the Sisters start with (yay).

-Facilities: Storage has been double, because there's a lot of crud in this mod.
-Heavy Bolter ammo is now wider rather than tall. Sisters of Battle don't get pockets (backpack) so now they can bring ammo around their belts instead.

Chaos changes:
Differences between the 4 powers are larger. 
-Nurgle have more hit points than ever and their various blight weapons cause some heavy fatal wounds. They have the strong acid attack, which the reworked sister power armor do not offer much protection against!
-Tzeentch have heavy armor and high accuracy, they pack krak and plasma weapons. 
-Khorne have good frontal armor and higher TU to close the distance. Their sisters pack chainaxes, eviscerators, flamethrowers and meltaguns!
-Slaanesh have high reaction stats, often pack the powerful sonic cannon and secondary power blade melee weapons.

Big Update 3:
Added sprite sheets for the Khorne Retributor and Superior.
Added BigOB corpse sprites for Rookie Khorne Sisters (Unbloodied), Sisters of Rage, Retributors and Retributor Superior.
Added codex entries and artwork (+armor sprites) for them and the Slaanesh Chosen Assassin.
Removed the "shield" from the lowest tier of Khorne sisters.
Added the Heavy Khorne Retributor racelist, it may now appear in certain terror and retaliation missions (low odds). 
Also added slight randomization to the standard Khorne list, Retributors may now appear here as well.
Gave Space Marines Terminators a slight armor buff.

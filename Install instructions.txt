This mod is set up as a Submod of the 40k mod.
Extract ROSIGMA to a seperate folder in your Documents\OpenXcom\mods\ -folder (make sure your OXCE install reads from this, or whatever mod folder directory you are using, you can check this in the ingame options menu, there's a button for "Folders").

Turn on the mod in OpenXCom (extended), it should appear as the 40k ROSIGMA mod.

Requires the latest vanilla 40k mod version and stable OXCE release.

Troubleshooting potential issues (the perils of openxcom/mods):
- There's error messages and OXCE won't load with the mod after updating 40k or ROSIGMA! I put the zip file in the mod folder and extracted! 
Answer: Remember to remove old mod installation folders (40k and ROSIGMA) when updating and not leave a .zip file AND the extracted folder in the mod folder. OXCE will read from both! (or try to). 
- The Mod doesn't show up, I extracted the mod into the mod folder and there's no old version or zip file in there!
Answer: Could be an extraction failure, check so that the mod has a metadata file in its folder, and that all folders match the zip content. A failed extraction can leave out some important files!
- You install a new update of OXCE, yet the mods aren't showing up! I've checked and all the files are there, no leftover zip or anything, what gives? 
Answer: If you've updated OXCE with the installer, there could be two OXCE installations, with the old one remaining somewhere, not reading from the same mod folder. Can happen with non-default installation directions.
- The Mod list in game does not show the ROSIGMA mod at all despite it being in the right mod folder and OXCE having just one installation! Ah!! 
Answer: This can be due to OXCE not updating its mod index, try switching mods (using the drop down menu in game) and make sure that OXCE *loads* the new mod or OG XCOM.  

This should catch 99% of installation woes. 


Summary of Additions in ROSIGMA vs vanilla 40k.
- Quality of Life Changes like automated training mission to reduce tedium, and a new automated Kill Token System that reduces the need to manually convert corpses and keep large corpse freezers.
- Reduced Grind in terms of Adamantium and Promethium costs (for all but the most exclusive stuff). 

-A General rebalance of battle and weapons engagement ranges, including a reduction in grenade ranges and introduction of heavy weapons scripts that make small arms more attractive for "tactical movement".
-There's several additions and changes mainly to Imperial Guard and Adeptas, with many quality of life and upgrades carrying over to the Arbites. 
- Space Marines and Primaris have smaller additions, and are mainly rebalanced for new weapon ranges, armor values and stats of ROSIGMA. In general, Marines have higher starting stats and are less likely to be "XCOM Rookie" level of poor bravery/panic prone.
- Grey Knights/Chamber Militants have large additions in the form of new Inquisitors, starting retinue, Inquisitor Storm Troopers, Assassins and Radical/Heretical paths, special events and so on.

- Campaign Difficulty rebalance, with all non Marine factions having a gentler and longer ramp of new enemy factions introduced, until they research mid-tier. All major factions are guaranteed to make a showing.
- Plasma weapons (for enemies) are introduced much later. 

- Enemy changes are large, with a greatly expanded rooster of enemy units for pretty much all factions. Orks have many new units like Flashgits. Kommandoz, Stormboyz, Tankhuntas, Deffkopters, Warbikes, Weirdboyz and the Warboss.
- New Chaos Cults, the Tzeentch and Nurgle one with all new units and weapons. New Daemons are introduced for both.
- The Genestealer Cult, with a large variety of enemies and special events, their own bases and craft etc.
- Dozens of new Chaos Craft.
- Tougher Daemons that don't go down to one burst of autofire, and have secondary abilities.
- Expanded mid-tier enemies like the Chaos Sister factions, the Chaos Squat and the Blackstone Chaos Guard.
- Chaos Space Marines are introduced later, but are stronger and will really start to test you by late summer.

-New Final Mission variants, for each faction, map changes etc. In general, much harder and more difficult to cheese. 


IMPERIAL GUARD:
- Elite and Abhuman Strategies. Elite gives you Scions out the gate, but they are tough to replace and they have more difficulty getting chaff troops. They also start with different transport option (the Taurox with autocannons). The Abhumans have access to Beastmen, Squat and Ogryns. They have fewer healing options, transports or exotic weapons.
- Imperial Guard gets access to Vindicare Assassins.
- New Guard Power Armor/Void Armors and Rotor Cannons.
- Expanded 4-tile unit options.
- Krieg Regiment options, with upgrade path to Grenadiers and Panzergrenadiers.
- Buffed Chimera turrets range and firepower, with an additional Chimera instead of the Hydra in the Convoy. 
- Heavy Weapons team mechanics and scripts. 

ADEPTAS:
- Rebalanced Weapons and Early Research with a new "Arsenal of Faith" that fills out the starting tier of weapons with more options. From Autostubbers to grenade launchers, snipers, rocket launchers etc.
- New Novice tier of armors and "soldiers", that can be promoted to Battle Sisters.
- New mid-tier of Battle Sister Armors, the Elohim, Retributor and Sister Superior (new SoldierType that has promotion track to Canoness).
- Assassin armor upgrade path that leads to the Death Cult Assassin.
- Frateris Militia with Veteran upgrade track, they can eventually also be turned into Novices if they prove their worth.

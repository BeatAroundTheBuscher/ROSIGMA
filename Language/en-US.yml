  STR_TZEENTCH_SISTERS_BACKSTORY: "{NEWLINE}The Abbey of Saint Catharin fell to treachery and deciet, most of the unalerted Sisters being captured alive by the forces of Tzeentch plot before they could muster arms. The Majority of Sisters Did not break nor bend, even when bearing witness to a Lord of Change. These Sisters were turned to serve Chaos through a modified Mortification process, over a number of days bound to serve the will of the Sorcerers of Tzeentch." #Going with the Puppet theme, the purest and strongest are turned into bound pawns of Tzeentch, while the weak willed are elevated to power. Cruel mockery! Heretical damnation!
  STR_CHAOS_MORTIFICATION: "{NEWLINE}The holy process of Mortification, used to rightfully punish deserters and traitors, has been twisted into mockery by the Sorcerers of Tzeentch. Changed Neuro-agonizer arrays and obloquial enhancers amplify the abilities of unsactioned chaos psykers to control the Mortified, while a baffle hood masks feeds them a constant stream of heretical whispers and images. Through this absolute control, their Tzeentch Superiors drive them into a joyless frenzy, forcing them to kill their former allies. Rather than being forced to face their torment in absolute isolation, it is shared through the unit, their body encased in a Chaos produced Anchorite Armor suit, enduring years or even decades of agony, not even death their salvation, as their minds can be brought back as long as a single unit survives to rejoin Chaos." #Grimdark, yet somehow not more so than the actual Mortifier/Anchoite lore.

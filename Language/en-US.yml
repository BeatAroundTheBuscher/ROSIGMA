  STR_ADVANCED_TURRETS_UFOPEDIA: "{NEWLINE} Some crafts require you to choose their armaments for the ground battle, otherwise they'll have none. These crafts have a second page with the list of slots and supported armaments.{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE} You have to buy the supported armament(s), of the supported slot-type(s) (turret, hull, sponson), and put it(them) into the craft's inventory. All weapons will be spawned when the battle starts."

  STR_PICK_STRATEGY_UFOPEDIA: "{NEWLINE}   Commander,{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}Please have your research adepts log your desired strategy for your forces so proper requisitons can commence. An initial shipment of wargear and deployment of will be delivered to your headquarters once the adepts' work is completed.{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}More advanced requisitions can be made once you have your adepts apply for access to specialized weaponry and support wargear, and have proven a source of manufacturing materials is available on-planet.{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}Descriptions of the available strategies follow on the next few entries of your Codex. {ALT}Only one strategy may ever be selected."

  STR_NOVICE_STRATEGY_ADEPTAS_UFOPEDIA: "{NEWLINE} Train and promote Adeptas Novices to Battle Sister status and gain access to the full Adeptas faction tree. Novices do not start with full power armor but use a form of Carapace armor. You will find promotions in the manufacturing menu, they may require combat experience and minimum stats. {NEWLINE} You will receive 12 Novices and 2 Novitiate Superiors along with an Adeptas Arvus and Rhino convoy within days of game start. {NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{ALT}This is the default Strategy{ALT}."

  STR_ELITE_STRATEGY_ADEPTAS_UFOPEDIA: "{NEWLINE} Begin with access to the powerful veteran Dominion Sisters and other elite units, relying on these expensive troops require careful management of attrition in the field and consistent high kill ratios. Dominions are requisitioned through the manufacturing interface, at the cost of kill tokens and credits. {NEWLINE} Within days you will receive 8 veteran sisters, a drop pod and a Thunderhawk."
  STR_REPENTIA_STRATEGY_ADEPTAS_UFOPEDIA: "{NEWLINE} Steel isn't strong, flesh is stronger! Rid yourself of sin and power armor. This sub-strategy gives you access to recruiting unredeemable Sister Repentia, Frateris Militia and Penitent Engines from the start.

  STR_ELITE_STRATEGY_IG_UFOPEDIA: "{NEWLINE} Take command of an elite Scion kill team and rely on your superior skills to earn kill tokens to recruit more Scions.

Leaving them be will displease planet authorities immensely.{ALT} >>"
  STR_SPACEHULKS2_UFOPEDIA: "{NEWLINE} The mission itself may prove to be quite challenging - deadly enemies, that may get several waves of reinforcements, if you are not quick enough, close quarters combat and corridors that are {ALT}too tight for big units{ALT}. {NEWLINE}{NEWLINE} As such, be sure to prepare accordingly - focus more on close range weapons, such as shotguns and flamers, or quick and compact weapons, like high power pistols and carbines. Pick experienced and quick soldiers with good reaction.{ALT} << >>"
  STR_SPACEHULKS3_UFOPEDIA: "{NEWLINE} The first level the Space Hulk will be quite straightforward - find the elevator to the second level and board it with any amount of soldiers, killing any enemies you encounter along the way, but you better be quick and get to the elevator before enemy reinforcements arrive.{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE} Should any soldiers be left behind after activating the elevator they will seek shelter in your landing craft until your return.{ALT}   << >>"
  STR_SPACEHULKS4_UFOPEDIA: "{NEWLINE} After advancing to the second level, you need to find the control console on upper floors and destroy it. Trying to kill all incoming waves of enemies, even though is possible, may take too much of your strength and resources, so it's advised to prioritize search and destruction of the console above anything else and be fast about it. {NEWLINE}{NEWLINE} You'll be presented with a visual confirmation of the control console, but that spinning thing is hard to miss.{ALT} <<"

  STR_TAU_FIREWARRIORAI: "Fire Warrior Shas'la"
  STR_TAU_FIREWARRIORAI_CODEX: "{NEWLINE}Rank and file of the Tau Empire, these despicable blue-skinned xenos utilize armor about on par with Imperial carapace and so-called pulse weapons of significant accuracy and lethality notably capable of defeating power armor. However, once engaged in melee, these cowardly aliens prove vulnerable."
  STR_TAUFIREWARRIOR_ARMOR: "Fire Warrior Shas'la Armor"
  STR_TAU_FIREWARRIORAI_ARMOR: "Fire Warrior Shas'la Armor"
  STR_TAUFIREWARRIOR_ARMOR_CODEX: "{NEWLINE}Though comparable to our carapace armor, this standard Tau armor is admittedly more lightweight and notably more effective at protecting its wearer, featuring some kind of esoteric nanoengineered composite. Unfortunately, it is beyond our current means and resources to duplicate."
  STR_TAUFIREWARRIOR_AICORPSE: "Fire Warrior Shas'la Corpse"

  STR_TAU_DRONEAI: "Tau Heavy Gun Drone"
  STR_TAU_DRONEAI_CODEX: "{NEWLINE}As one might expect, these represent wholly mechanical, and heretical, gun servitors of the Tau Empire. Though not especially durable, they are equipped with sophisticated sensors and powerful weapons and represent a deadly threat to our forces."
  STR_TAUDRONE_ARMOR: "Tau Drone Armor"
  STR_TAU_DRONEAI_ARMOR: "Tau Drone Armor"
  STR_TAUDRONE_ARMOR_CODEX: "{NEWLINE}Light, but tough for its weight and density, Tau Drones are clad in much the same nanoengineered composite materials that comprise the bulk of Tau infantry body armor."
  STR_TAUDRONE_AICORPSE: "Tau Drone Corpse"

  STR_TAU_FIREWARRIORPATHFINDERAI: "Fire Warrior Pathfinder"
  STR_TAU_FIREWARRIORPATHFINDERAI_CODEX: "{NEWLINE}Pathfinders are the main scouting infantry forces of the T'au Empire. As part of this duty, they are charged with utilizing targeting lasers known as 'Marker Lights' to improve the accuracy of other Tau weapons. In addition, superior optics and an aptitude at stealth make them credible threats to our forces."
  STR_TAUFIREWARRIORPATHFINDER_ARMOR: "Fire Warrior Pathfinder Armor"
  STR_TAUFIREWARRIORPATHFINDER_ARMOR_CODEX: "{NEWLINE}Slightly less fortified than its Fire Warrior counterpart, Pathfinder armor evidently exchanges a degree of protection for mobility. Typically these suits feature some manner of camouflage and superior optics, but are otherwise identical to the Tau standard."
  STR_TAUFIREWARRIORPATHFINDER_AICORPSE: "Fire Warrior Pathfinder Corpse"

  STR_TAU_FIREWARRIORLEADERAI: "Fire Warrior Shas'ui"
  STR_TAU_FIREWARRIORLEADERAI_CODEX: "{NEWLINE}Squad leaders and commanders of smaller ships and divisions, we've identified these red-clad xenos as low-level Tau leadership of their military presence. Though typically more skilled and bearing many of the same arms as Tau of the lower rank, their armor is a cut above, with basic energy shielding."
  STR_TAUFIREWARRIORLEADER_ARMOR: "Fire Warrior Shas'ui Armor"
  STR_TAU_FIREWARRIOR_LEADERAI_ARMOR: "Fire Warrior Shas'ui Armor"
  STR_TAUFIREWARRIORLEADER_ARMOR_CODEX: "{NEWLINE}Superior in just about every way to the standard Fire Warrior armor, suits issued to Fire Warrior leaders is both lighter and more resilient, with an integrated energy shield generator and especially performant optical array."
  STR_TAUFIREWARRIORLEADER_AICORPSE: "Fire Warrior Shas'ui Corpse"

  STR_TAU_FIREWARRIORCAPTAINAI: "Fire Warrior Shas'el"
  STR_TAU_FIREWARRIORCAPTAINAI_CODEX: "{NEWLINE}So far as we can tell, these xenos represent the mid-level leadership of the Tau Empire, often found in command of their larger ships and deployments. As one might expect, they wield some of the best armor and weaponry on offer by the Tau and feature considerable accuracy and prowess."
  STR_TAUFIREWARRIORCAPTAIN_ARMOR: "Fire Warrior Shas'el Armor"
  STR_TAU_FIREWARRIORICAPTAINAI_ARMOR: "Fire Warrior Shas'el Armor"
  STR_TAUFIREWARRIORCAPTAIN_ARMOR_CODEX: "{NEWLINE}Among the greatest example of Tau composite infantry armor we've yet discovered, those worn by their captains are masterworks even by Tau standards, touting protection nearly comparable to our Astartes power armor, alongside integrated shielding and highly advanced optics."
  STR_TAUFIREWARRIORCAPTAIN_AICORPSE: "Fire Warrior Shas'el Corpse"

  STR_TAU_GUEVESALV1AI: "Gue'vesa'la"
  STR_TAU_GUEVESALV1AI_CODEX: "{NEWLINE}Lowly traitors and scum that have given up the superior glories of the Emperor and His Imperium in exchange for the miserable and corrupt decadence of the Tau Empire. They utilize a mix of forsaken Tau xenotech and misappropriated Imperium weaponry, but are otherwise feeble and easily slain. Show them no mercy."
  STR_TAUGUEVESAFLAK_ARMOR: "Gue'vesa'la Armor"
  STR_TAUGUEVESAFLAK_ARMOR_CODEX: "{NEWLINE}Nearly identical to our standard guard flak pattern, these Tau adulterated versions impregnate its plating with their signature Xeno nanocomposites, reducing its weight and improving overall efficacy."
  STR_TAU_GUEVESALV2AI: "Gue'vesa'ui"
  STR_TAU_GUEVESALV2AI_CODEX: "{NEWLINE}Traitor humans of skill and experience comparable to our veterans and stormtroopers. Though clearly weak willed and thoroughly indoctrinated to the perverse cult of the Tau, these are capable foes routinely entrusted with standard Tau small arms alongside specialist weapons of the Imperium."
  STR_TAUGUEVESACARAP_ARMOR: "Gue'vesa'ui Armor"
  STR_TAUGUEVESACARAP_ARMOR_CODEX: "{NEWLINE}Functionally the same the carapace equivalent worn by Tau Firewarriors, the variants donned by traitor men are just as well furnished and equipped, albeit tailored to the superior human form. Likewise, they offer comparably superior protection versus Imperial equivalents."

  STR_TAU_PULSE_RIFLE: "Tau Pulse Rifle"
  STR_TAU_PULSE_RIFLE_CODEX: "{NEWLINE}The primary infantry weapon of the cursed Tau. Though unquestionably blasphemous, they are highly accurate, long ranged and powerful firearms regretably capable of defeating even Astartes power armor. These weapons work by firing alloy slugs that are ionized into plasma and rapidly accelerated to extreme speeds with electromagnetic pulses."
  STR_TAU_PULSE_MAG: "Tau Pulse Charge"
  STR_TAU_PULSE_MAG_CODEX: "{NEWLINE}This heinous object is fundamentally a battery used to store the power required for the operation of man-portable Tau pulse weaponry, and their demanding electromagnetic arrays in particular. Despite being the product of a vastly inferior species, its energy density is nonetheless impressive."
  STR_TAU_PULSE_MAG_EXPORT: "Tau Export Pulse Charge"
  STR_TAU_PULSE_MAG_EXPORT_CODEX: "{NEWLINE}Much like the superior battery it is derived from, this low-performing variant is specifically meant for use in equally inferior export versions of Tau pulse weapons meant for their less trusted trade partners (us)."
  STR_TAU_PULSE_CARBINE: "Tau Pulse Carbine"
  STR_TAU_PULSE_CARBINE_CODEX: "{NEWLINE}A CQC oriented variant of the Tau Pulse Rifle, it works by the same principles, electromagnetically discharging high velocity ionized slugs. Notably, this carbine forfeits some of the range and accuracy of its rifle counterpart for a significantly greater fire rate, reduced weight and superior readiness. It also comes equipped with an integrated underslung photon grenade launcher."
  STR_TAU_PULSE_BLASTER: "Tau Pulse Blaster"
  STR_TAU_PULSE_BLASTER_CODEX: "{NEWLINE}This is effectively the Tau equivalent of a shotgun, specialized in CQC. It utilizes their signature pulse technology to fire a cluster of deadly ionized projectiles. The dispersal of the weapon's energy over multiple microslugs makes it less effective at penetrating armor, but with lethality easily on par with a Ripper Gun it should not be underestimated."
  STR_TAU_PULSE_PISTOL: "Tau Pulse Pistol"
  STR_TAU_PULSE_PISTOL_CODEX: "{NEWLINE}As befits their appearance, these firearms are lightweight sidearms featuring a minaturized version of the same technology and electromagnetic arrays seen in other Tau pulse weapons. Despite their substantially reduced size, they hit just as hard as their longarm counterparts, albeit with reduced effective range and rate of fire."
  STR_TAU_PULSE_RIFLE_EXPORT: "Tau Export Pulse Rifle"
  STR_TAU_PULSE_RIFLE_EXPORT_CODEX: "{NEWLINE}A notably inferior, yet still effective counterpart of the Tau Pulse Rifle with reduced fire rate, range and accuracy, this handicapped model is meant for milita and domestic use, as armament for less trusted irregulars, or trade goods with about equally distrusted species outside of the Tau Empire; in this case, we class as the latter."
  STR_TAU_RAIL_RIFLE: "Tau Rail Rifle"
  STR_TAU_RAIL_RIFLE_CODEX: "{NEWLINE}A bulky and unwieldy but devastating firearm, the Tau Rail Rifle is a manportable version of anti-materiel weaponry commonly seen on Tau vehicles. EM arrays are used by the gun to propel a trilium-tipped solid dart slug to hyper velocities, rendering it capable of easily penetrating even Terminator and heavy vehicular armor; it will surely obliterate any infantry unfortunate enough to be hit by it."
  STR_TAU_RAIL_MAG: "Tau Rail Rifle Canister"
  STR_TAU_RAIL_MAG_CODEX: "{NEWLINE}The true limiter of the Tau Rail Rifle is not the supply of physical projectiles so much as the immense power it requires. To that end, its most important 'munition' consists of hyperdense rounded battery canisters that, despite their impressive yield, are rapidly spent. Apparently these local instances are innovations on the Tau standard, able to fire two shots in lieu of one before depletion."
  STR_TAU_TRADING: "Tau Trade Agreement"
  STR_TAU_TRADING_CODEX: "{NEWLINE}Per recent discussions with Tau leaders, we have managed to come to a tentative agreement concerning the supply of export models of Tau Pulse Rifles and ammo at our Trading Posts. Though the Sectors and local governors will surely not look favourably upon such a Faustian bargain, desperate times call for equally desperate measures."
  STR_TAU_XENOTECH: "Tau Xenotech"
  STR_TAU_XENOTECH_CODEX: "{NEWLINE}Thanks to the tireless efforts of our adepts, and a few vigourously bloody interrogations, we have managed to deepen our understanding of Tau technology to the point of successfully jailbreaking their firearms and bypassing their genelocks. While heinous and repugnant, they should nonetheless prove to be effective weapons in our arsenal against the enemies of Man."
  STR_TAU_PHOTON_GRENADE: "Tau Photon Grenade"
  STR_TAU_PHOTON_GRENADE_CODEX: "{NEWLINE}These disc-like xeno objects function almost identically to our photon grenades, utilizing a chemical reaction to detonate in a less lethal burst of disorienting light and sound, albeit with greater power due to its unique composition. The aerodynamic nature of the charge allows it to be thrown further than our own counterpats."
  STR_TAU_PHOTON_GRENADE_CARBINE: "Tau Carbine Photon Grenade"
  STR_TAU_PHOTON_GRENADE_CARBINE_CODEX: "{NEWLINE}Fundamentally identical to their hand-thrown Tau counterparts with the same disc-like shape and disorienting function, these variants are meant to be loaded into the Tau Pulse Carbine's underslung launcher."
  STR_TAU_FUSION_GRENADE: "Tau Fusion Grenade"
  STR_TAU_FUSION_GRENADE_CODEX: "{NEWLINE}Anti-armor throwables that could be considered an approximate equivalent to our melta grenades, these function by hyperheating their immediate vicinity and then creating a localized nuclear fusion detonation."
  STR_TAU_EMP_GRENADE: "Tau EMP Grenade"
  STR_TAU_EMP_GRENADE_CODEX: "{NEWLINE}Specialist gear, these grenades do immense damage to most mechanized and electronic equipment by creating a powerful electromagnetic pulse, largely bypassing even heavy armor. While it can be disorienting to organics, it will largely leave them unharmed."

The trusty bolter can overpower it and damage it if the shot penetrates. Meltas are designed to destroy armor but fall off with range. Plasma is capable of both penetrating and damaging armor.

  STR_DEVELOPING_YOUR_ARMORY_UFOPEDIA: "{NEWLINE}Without access to off-planet communications our adepts will need time to accumulate the knowledge necessary to manufacture advanced weapons, and you will need to choose which research they focus on. If we are able to capture and research certain enemies and weapons our adepts will be able to discover some technologies much sooner than they otherwise would be able to. Remember to check captured enemy weapons for research that requires them before simply selling them."
  STR_ENEMY_BASES: "Enemy Bases"
  STR_ENEMY_BASES_UFOPEDIA: "{NEWLINE}The foes of the Imperium are numberous, but there are certain characteristics common among the various enemy bases you may encounter. Each enemy base on the planet reduces your monthly score, and can also launch missions that need to be addressed if you want to maintain the support (and funding) of the various planetary officials. If left unchallenged bases can grow in strength over time, causing them to be occupied by more elite troops and creating more problems for you on the geoscape."
  STR_DETECTING_BASES: "Detecting Enemy Bases"
  STR_DETECTING_BASES_UFOPEDIA: "{NEWLINE}New enemy bases on the geoscape are generally not automatically detected by our agents. Each month our agents will attempt to locate bases and inform you of them, however you can take a more proactive approach by sending out craft to scout for them. Take note of the presence of enemy craft and attempt to pinpoint their source, then send a craft to patrol the area for some time to reveal suspected bases."
  STR_RETAKING_SECTORS: "Retaking Captured Sectors"
  STR_RETAKING_SECTORS_UFOPEDIA: "{NEWLINE}The foes of man will sometimes capture sectors of Pelaga IV, wresting them from Imperial control and preventing you from receiving monthly funding from them. This happens when the enemy establishes certain bases in the region. Locating and destroying them will return the populace to the light of the Emperor."
  STR_HUNT_MISSIONS: "Hunt Missions"
  STR_HUNT_MISSIONS_UFOPEDIA: "{NEWLINE}Some enemy bases will send out interceptors to hunt down your craft if they enter their airspace. Take note of bases that have visible radar ranges on the geoscape, and avoid sending craft that can't hold their own in a dogfight into these areas."
  STR_MISSIONS_GEOSCAPE: "Missions on the Geoscape"
  STR_MISSIONS_GEOSCAPE_UFOPEDIA: "{NEWLINE}You will periodically be informed of missions appearing on the geoscape. Failing to complete these will typically result in a loss of monthly score."
  STR_HELP_DEPLOYMENT: "{NEWLINE}Some craft, such as drop pods, have delayed deployment only allowing your soldiers to move out after the end of the first turn of battle. This can be an advantage or disadvantage depending on the objective of the mission. Remember to consider this, as well as the other features of each craft, when choosing which craft to send on each mission."
  STR_AIR_STRIKES: "Air Strikes"
  STR_AIR_STRIKES_UFOPEDIA: "{NEWLINE}Placeholder text, need to figure out how these actually work before I can describe them {ALT}:P{ALT}"
  STR_MANAGING_SOLDIERS: "Managing Your Soldiers"
  STR_MANAGING_SOLDIERS_UFOPEDIA: "{NEWLINE}Throughout the course of your campaign you will be in charge of a constantly expanding roster of soldiers, including rescued survivors from successful missions. Many of them will become eligiable for promotion as they achieve personal commendations and as you unlock new research."
  STR_TRAINING_SOLDIERS: "Soldier Training"
  STR_TRAINING_SOLDIERS_UFOPEDIA: "{NEWLINE}Some facilities soldiers to train without sending them into battle. To do so simply go to the soldiers menu at the base they are housed at, click the Soldier Info dropdown, and select {ALT}Training{ALT}. From here you will be able to select which soldiers to train. Refer to the codex pages for individual facilities for their capacity.{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}Soldiers in training will slowly increase their stats to a maximum depending on their type, and wounded soldiers won't train until they are healed."

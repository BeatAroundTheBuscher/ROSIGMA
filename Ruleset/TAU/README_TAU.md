# Notes
- Guarantee a mission to rescue a tank by the 10th or 12th.
- Default weapon sets for everyone
- Very hard to get thru Chaos Aspirants with the starter weapon sets. Good!
    - Things that should mathhammer on Chaos Aspirants
    - Need direct hits with shotgun gas rounds - not effective in general combat
    - Accatran missile hit does quite a bit of damage - Krak does a ton
    - Make Tau Chimera turrets and hull bolter - burst cannon on the front and twin-linked rail rifle / twin-linked burst cannon turrets
- STR_STEELMILLR what is this for? Comes from Adamantium Component

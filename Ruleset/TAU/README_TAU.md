# Notes
- Guarantee a mission to rescue a tank by the 10th or 12th.
- Default weapon sets for everyone
- Very hard to get thru Chaos Aspirants with the starter weapon sets. Good!
    - Things that should mathhammer on Chaos Aspirants
    - Need direct hits with shotgun gas rounds - not effective in general combat
    - Accatran missile hit does quite a bit of damage - Krak does a ton
    - Make Tau Chimera turrets and hull bolter - burst cannon on the front and twin-linked rail rifle / twin-linked burst cannon turrets
- STR_STEELMILLR what is this for? Comes from Adamantium Component

### Escort around a rock band. Daft Punk jokes.

### How to handle Tau moving in.
# You attack Inquisition base to get them?
# You rescue them from an Imperial hideout?
# Water Caste use hooded woman for now.
# Let's assume you get them and put in fancy missions later.

### What's left
# Method of recruiting all Tau Fire Caste and Water Caste. Will show up with fleet. - Destroy ABM SAM site to get Fleet for free - or pay -1000 for it
# Initial pulse of Tau. Will come with A Secret Pact from embassy staff

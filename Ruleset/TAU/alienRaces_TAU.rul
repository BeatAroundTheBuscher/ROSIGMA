### Thoughts/designs on alienRaces
# Enemy forces are
# - Traitor Khorne Guard : your regiment and Imperial Guard command on planet - The White Prince? Classic Weaters scheme guy
#   - White Prince is usurped by Imperial officials, rebels, thought killed, reappears later and stronger, many PDF units defect to him and he throws back the planetary governor, you are deployed to defeat him
# - Slaanesh Ecclesiarchs : a bloodthirsty pogrom made up of Frateris, rabble, and Redemptionists (to start)
#   - STR_REDEMPTIONIST_*
# - Tzeentch Inquisitor : this person is masterminding the warp storm
# - Nurgle Black Templar : this apothecary becomes obsessed with deploying bioweapons?

# What factions do I put in

# ex- 145th Saragusan Rifles "Tenax" Traitor Guard
#   - General Detzenef orders the regiment into disaster and then stalemate
#   - The regiment turns to Khorne rituals to become more powerful
#   - Initially highly organized Blood Pact type Khornate force that disintegrates into warbands
# Redemptionist Cardinal Isgori + the White Prince
#   - Isgori is a corrupt media obsessed Ecclesiarch in love with the delight of fire
#   - The White Prince is a scion of a noble family who was cut out of the planetary governorate due to rumors of mental instability
#   - Redemptionists
#   - Frateris + Crusaders
#   - Slaanesh traitor guard
#   - Young nobles who are out shooting
#   - Slaanesh Bloody Rose?
# Argent Shroud Sisters who are caught in the middle of all this
# Black Templar Crusaders

# Final Mission Ideas
# Defeat all normal Imperial and Chaos factions
# Use the planetary governor's signet ring, Imperial Crusade comms authority, and Inquisition authentication to signal the Imperial sector fleet
# - Storm the Silver Tower
# - Storm the Black Templar base
# - Storm the Watch Fortress
#   - Only gue'vesa can storm the Watch Fortress or automated alarms will sound
# Ambush and destroy the Imperial Fleet in a boarding action

# Mission Themes
# Early
# 1. Attack on important promethium refinery or ocean-farming rig
# 2. Crusade or slave raid or gang war against hivers
# 3. Attack on merchant convoy
# 4. Attack on Imperial food warehouse
# 5. Attack on Sisters aid shrine
# 6. Attack on Imperial convoy

# Inquisitor Stirling

# Characters + Flow

# 9/14 TWEAK everything. ISGORI is now TZEENTCH or UNDIVIDED aligned. THE WHITE PRINCE is now Slaaneshi aligned.

# - The ARGENT SHROUD
#   - Operating aid shrines while searching for the cause of the warp storm

#   + Slaanesh Guard levels up.

#   + Khorne and Slaaneshi cults level up as TENAX executes priests and the Golden Flame takes control of important shrines and cities.
#   + SLAVER raids intensify as Imperial government falters.
# - STIRLING delves into heretical lore and the sorceries of Tzeentch to attempt to alter the course of the warp storm.
#   + A Tzeentch cult nucleated around Stirling undermines the Imperial capital enclave.

# - You will need to construct a FLEET BEACON to help the TAU FLEET navigate thru the warp storm.
# Month 4:
# - Mid

# - STIRLING sacrifices Hive Fearghail in a dread ritual and delays the progress of the warp storm.
#   + Tzeentch cults spread throughout the hive and capital region

# - Advance Imperial forces begin to arrive.
# - INQUISITION ASSETS are now operating in the theater in earnest. Look out for KILL TEAMS.
# - The defenses of the capital and spaceport are stabilized by a rapid reaction team of Space Marines.
# - TENAX concentrates forces for a push into the Ecclesiarchal Districts. THE WHITE PRINCE and his increasingly debauched followers battle them desperately.

# - The IRON WARRIORS are summoned to the battlefield by Tenax's psykers out of fear for their lives.
# - Not to be outdone, ISGORI begins terrible rituals aimed at contacting Slaaneshi forces. Slaaneshi daemons and Chaos Marines begin to arrive.

# - TZEENTCH CULTISTS gain strength in Hive Fearghail and level up.
# Month 6:
# - Mid => Late Transition
# - The Imperial crusade arrives in force.
# - The Imperial crusade is just here to kill everyone pretty much.
#   + The BLACK TEMPLARS, DEATHWATCH, ULTRAMARINES, BLOODY ROSE, FRATERIS MILITIA, and IMPERIAL GUARD arrive to confront the Daemonic forces - and you.
# - The FRATERIS and BLOODY ROSE storm the capital and purge (most of) the Tzeentch cults within, along with anything else that they happen to see moving.
#   + A panicked STIRLING liquidates her coven and destroys her laboratory to help cover her tracks. In her haste she voids the bargain made with Tzeentch
# - ISGORI contacts the WORD BEARERS who all too readily agree to instruct him in sorcerous power in exchange for territory in the Ecclesiarchal Sanctorum.
# - THE WHITE PRINCE leads ever more daring commando raids upon the Imperial crusaders. His popularity grows among what is left of the civilian population.
#   + Many join his forces, but THE WHITE PRINCE truly seeks only his own glory. Others are but pawns and accessories to his rise.
# - TENAX's forces are forced to withdraw from their recent gains by the BLACK TEMPLARS but retreat in good order.
#   + Assisted by the IRON WARRIORS and more than well fortified, TENAX yields ground only grudgingly to the overconfident BLACK TEMPLARS and IMPERIAL GUARD.

# - The ULTRAMARINES secure the spaceport and start attempting to reconstitute the planetary militia.
# - The DEATHWATCH start performing sweeps and purges of Guevesa cultists.
# - TAU INDUSTRIAL BASE can be finished as early as this month.
#   + This will unlock Tau High Tier with suits and advanced weapons.
# Month 7:
# - Late => Late-Imperial Transition
# - The Warp storm suddenly intensifies and the jaws of Tzeentch's trap snap shut.
# - Daemon engines pour forth from the forges of the IRON WARRIORS.
# - Bolstered by the dread teachings of the WORD BEARERS, Isgori's Slaanesh-positive cult begins to summon more and more powerful daemons.
# - TENAX ambushes the BLACK TEMPLARS command with a nuclear barrage that badly damages the IMPERIAL GUARD and kills a number of BLACK TEMPLARS.
#   + He uses servitorized + fanatical troops to march through the craters and fallout and assault the stunned GUARD before they can recover.
#   + The GUARD are thrown back onto the defensive and only the presence of the BLACK TEMPLARS prevents disaster.
# - STIRLING rebuilds her coven by taking command of the Tzeentch-infiltrated 26TH GONFALON CHASSEURS.
#   + Soon enough she has installed her loyalists across the officer corps and purged any dissent from the ranks.
#   + With the warp storm raging STIRLING finds her sorceries more powerful than ever before.
#   + She cares little for her apprentices' lives, knowing that the planet's very survival is at stake, to say nothing of her reputation.
#   + She prepares a fortress inside the haunted ruins of Hive Fearghail.
# - The ULTRAMARINES realize that the planetary militia has gone over to the Tau.
# Month 8:
# - Late-Imperial from here on out

# - The player is able to maintain resupply thru local manufacturing and stealth supply drops from Tau forces.

#   + Aided by waves of drugged cultists, THE WHITE PRINCE drives the BLACK TEMPLARS back towards the spaceport.
#   + Ordered to support the BLACK TEMPLARS, the 26TH GONFALON falters and retreats to Hive Fearghail to link up with STIRLING.
# - Isgori's evil army of daemons and THE CULT OF THE GOLDEN FLAME battles the BLOODY ROSE, FRATERIS, TZEENTCH CULTS, and GUARD DESERTERS for the ruins of the capitol.
# - The DEATHWATCH declare you an Extremis-level threat.
# Month 9:
# - The BLACK TEMPLARS and ULTRAMARINES are forced back to a perimeter around the starport by the raging warp storm.
# - The DEATHWATCH refuses to cooperate in the planet's defense from Chaos and focuses on hunting you.
# - THE WHITE PRINCE seeks ascension to space marinehood via Slaaneshi rituals with captured Space Marine progenoids.
#   + He succeeds and is granted patronage by a Slaaneshi daemon, becoming a Flawless Blade equivalent champion.
#   + His patron immediately demands him to kill for its amusement and THE WHITE PRINCE proceeds with gusto.
# - The WORD BEARERS attempt to betray and sacrifice ISGORI to unleash a Greater Daemon.

soldiers:
# Fire Warriors. Currently no diff btwn Fire Warriors and Pathfinders beyond armor.
# stats are placeholders for shas'ui and higher
# TODO: Remember to do Tau bionics and maybe some kind of medal like Blooded or something

# Fire Warriors are bred and trained for war but are not superhuman
# Tabletop BS 4+ and Ld 7+ matches Guard stats in these regards
# So my thoughts are
# Managed genetics: Reliably usable soldiers in terms of bravery (40-60) and psiStrength (80-100).
# Overwatch specialists: Excellent reactions
# Mobile hunters: Good TU, stamina, firing accuracy
# Weak arms: Poor strength, melee, throwing
# Never psykers: No psiSkill, ever

# Guevesa cloned off IG ranks
# No Guevesa > Officer promotion for egalitarian Tau!
# You must go Gue'vesa'la > Gue'vesa'ui by veterancy
# Then you can go > Gue'vesa'vre by a promotion (with more veterancy).
# Guevesa cultists can become higher Gue'vesa by rank once A Secret Pact is researched as they are Old Gue'vesa

# == Soldier Types == 
# Fire Warriors (done)
# Guevesa (done)
# Need officer orders - Breach and Clear, Keep Firing!, Recon Sweep
# Beastmen gue'vesa (Morin'vesa - NYI)

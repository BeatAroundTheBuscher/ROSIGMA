#Econ Malus for the Randomized system hooked up to STR_HARD_MALUS_FUNDING_CONTINUAL. Needs to be written up. 
#Thinking there will be a span of malus effects that will randomly be selected biweekly or monthly. It can be as low as -50k, to -500k funds and -500 score.
#Do we want DIP PREVENTION, where events don´t fire if you don´t have positive score/cash? 
#Do we want RUBBERBANDING on the upside? Where harder hitting events will (can) trigger if the player has over X million cash in the bank?
#Design wise, these events will delay the player from snowballing, make campaigns longer and could contribute (a little) to a loss. Especially without DIP PREVENTION.
#WITH Dip Prevention, the player is incentivized to SPEN SPEND SPEND, so they have no cash to lose to events monthly. Getting that expensive (upkeep too) outpost or forge might make more sense.
#Saving up for base expansion can get tricky. The player will want to grabm ore loot, and do more missions to get that cash reserve up when needed.
#There will also be some sequential event chains with ramping costs, but if you survive (month 9+ for example) they are "Resolved". Maxes out at like -1 million funds. 
#For the future, whenever OXCE can handle it, I´d like to include multiple choice events where you can pay a resource (Kill/Honour Tokens) to avoid the economic or score impact of bad events.

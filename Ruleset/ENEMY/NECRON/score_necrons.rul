# Problem: Because Necrons are stunned and not killed, they end up as a live Alien recovery
#
# This means that the value score on the unit is not used. The live Alien recovery is always 10,
# unless there is a research topic. When a research topic for that unit exists 
# (or the one it gets transformed to by using liveAlien: ) then the applied score is double of unit
# (before transformation).
# Therefore follows that truly killed Necrons (HP <= 0) will always be half the real value, 
# which of course can be compensated by the score you get from the corpses
